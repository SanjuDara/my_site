    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Sanju Dara, a passionate Python enthusiast who believes that coding should be fun, accessible, and 
        empowering — whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your skills. This blog is all about 
        making Python easy to learn through clear explanations, practical examples, and beginner-friendly projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll find tutorials, tips, and real-world guides covering everything from Python basics to automation, 
        data analysis, and more. My goal is to help you build confidence in your coding journey, one line of Python 
        at a time.

    <p>Thanks for stopping by — let’s learn and grow together!</p>
